ðŸ§  GA-Enhanced Fuzzy Deep Learning Framework for Tumor Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a Fuzzy Deep Learning Framework enhanced with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for tumor classification from brain MRI images.
The project integrates Fuzzy Logic, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Evolutionary Optimization to improve interpretability and generalization in medical image analysis.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Early and accurate detection of brain tumors is critical in medical diagnosis.
While CNN-based models achieve high accuracy, they often lack explainability.
This project bridges that gap by introducing fuzzy membership functions within a CNN pipeline, optimized by a Genetic Algorithm to tune hyperparameters for enhanced performance and interpretability.

ðŸ§© Key Features

ðŸ§  Fuzzy Membership Layer: Adds interpretability by modeling uncertainty in feature activation.

ðŸ§¬ Genetic Algorithm (GA): Optimizes fuzzy centers, sigmas, and learning rates dynamically.

ðŸŽ¯ Deep CNN Backbone: Extracts spatial features from MRI scans efficiently.

ðŸ”¥ Heatmap Visualization: Highlights activated tumor regions using Grad-CAM.

ðŸ“Š Performance Evaluation: Includes validation accuracy, confusion matrix, and comparison charts.
